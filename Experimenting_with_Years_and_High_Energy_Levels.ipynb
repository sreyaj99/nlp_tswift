    "# Final project guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Use these guidelines if and only if you are pursuing a **final project of your own design**. For those taking the final exam instead of the project, see the (separate) final exam notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines are intended for **undergraduates enrolled in INFO 3350**. If you are a graduate student enrolled in INFO 6350, you're welcome to consult the information below, but you have wider latitude to design and develop your project in line with your research goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to: identify an interesting problem connected to the humanities or humanistic social sciences that's addressable with the help of computational methods, formulate a hypothesis about it, devise an experiment or experiments to test your hypothesis, present the results of your investigations, and discuss your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks essentially replicate the process of writing an academic paper. You can think of your project as a paper in miniature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to present each of these tasks as you see fit. You should use narrative text (that is, your own writing in a markdown cell), citations of others' work, numerical results, tables of data, and static and/or interactive visualizations as appropriate. Total length is flexible and depends on the number of people involved in the work, as well as the specific balance you strike between the ambition of your question and the sophistication of your methods. But be aware that numbers never, ever speak for themselves. Quantitative results presented without substantial discussion will not earn high marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should reflect, at minimum, ten **or more** hours of work by each participant, though you will be graded on the quality of your work, not the amount of time it took you to produce it. Most high-quality projects represent twenty or more hours of work by each member.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pick an important and interesting problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "No amount of technical sophistication will overcome a fundamentally uninteresting problem at the core of your work. You have seen many pieces of successful computational humanities research over the course of the semester. You might use these as a guide to the kinds of problems that interest scholars in a range of humanities disciplines. You may also want to spend some time in the library, reading recent books and articles in the professional literature. **Problem selection and motivation are integral parts of the project.** Do not neglect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your project as a Jupyter notebook, along with all data necessary to reproduce your analysis. If your dataset is too large to share easily, let us know in advance so that we can find a workaround. If you have a reason to prefer a presentation format other than a notebook, likewise let us know so that we can discuss the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should have four basic sections (provided in cells below for ease of reference):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction and hypothesis.** What problem are you working on? Why is it interesting and important? What have other people said about it? What do you expect to find?\n",
    "2. **Corpus, data, and methods.** What data have you used? Where did it come from? How did you collect it? What are its limitations or omissions? What major methods will you use to analyze it? Why are those methods the appropriate ones?\n",
    "3. **Results.** What did you find? How did you find it? How should we read your figures? Be sure to include confidence intervals or other measures of statistical significance or uncetainty where appropriate.\n",
    "4. **Discussion and conclusions.** What does it all mean? Do your results support your hypothesis? Why or why not? What are the limitations of your study and how might those limitations be addressed in future work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of those sections, you may use as many code and markdown cells as you like. You may, of course, address additional questions or issues not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code used in the project should be present in the notebook (except for widely-available libraries that you import), but **be sure that we can read and understand your report in full without rerunning the code**. Be sure, too, to explain what you're doing along the way, both by describing your data and methods and by writing clean, well commented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes the place of the take-home final exam for the course. It is worth 35% of your overall grade. You will be graded on the quality and ambition of each aspect of the project. No single component is more important than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project is due at **noon on Saturday, December 9** via upload to CMS of a single zip file containing your fully executed Jupyter notebook and all associated data.\n",
    "* You may work alone or in a group of up to three total members.\n",
    "    * If you work in a group, be sure to list the names of the group members.\n",
    "    * For groups, create your group on CMS and submit one notebook for the entire group. **Each group should also submit a statement of responsibility** that describes in general terms who performed which parts of the project.\n",
    "* You may post questions on Ed, but should do so privately (visible to course staff only).\n",
    "* Interactive visualizations do not always work when embedded in shared notebooks. If you plan to use interactives, you may need to host them elsewhere and link to them.\n",
    "\n",

    "We read in Taylor Swift song lyrics and spotify data from a csv that adashofdata created and housed on a github repository: https://github.com/adashofdata/taylor_swift_data. We checked all her files and checked the lyrics and song names and confirmed that this data was 1) better than any Kaggle Dataset that we found 2) produced the same results as we would if we were to scrape Spotify for every Taylor Swift song. \n",
    "\n",
    "While adashofdata has way more spreadsheets then we needed, such as we ruled out needing Taylor_Swift_Set_List_Data which hosts a set list from her six tours, and Taylor_Swift_Words, which houses a breakdown of her lyrics into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also reviewed what adashofdata had done with the data, which she used to create a blog post: http://adashofdata.com/2023/03/01/a-data-scientist-breaks-down-all-10-taylor-swift-albums-the-extended-version/, a video virtually a summary of her blog post: https://youtu.be/ZNFms8sUbTw, and a few Reddit threads with the same findings: https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11g46c5/all_the_colors_mentioned_in_each_taylor_swift/, https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11f6xa8/taylor_swift_writes_a_song_in_every_key_on/, and https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11mv3sn/taylor_says_she_imagines_writing_her_songs_with_3/. AdashofData's findings did not align with our discussion as below we look at how her song lyrics can assist in the prediction of which Year the song is released and whether we can classify a song as High Energy or not. Adashofdata's findings are indeed interesting and we support you if you wish to understand more about seasonality of Taylor Swift, which Days of the Week she talked about, swear words and more!"

    "**Limitations** of the data include the fact that we decided not to include any songs that Taylor Swift re-recorded: Fearless(Taylor's Version), Red(Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version), etc. This was due to the overlap and the fact that we desired to see if her music has potentially evolved or changed since starting her career and thus re-released songs would have potentially hindered our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other pitfalls include our data reviews 133 songs below, but songs that she created for another Artist/TV Shows/etc and lawsuits that occurred that made artists place her name on the writers list were not included. Also overlapping songs where she re-recorded with a featured artist were not included as well to avoid repetition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was extremely clean and thus if you search up the lyrics for certain lyrics they will not include quotations around words that the author says, but due to cleaning ours does."

It is especially narrow in the 2015-ish region showcasing more confidence in that specific area of year. One noticable distress is the fact that there is quite a bit of scatter around the line of best fit suggesting that there is some noise in the data or the model is not able to perfectly capture all the factors that influence an album release date, in the future when there is more data available we could potentially look at Taylor Swift's mood, fashion, tour, etc. to predict the year better.\n",

    "The Naive $R^2$ measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable, the $\\hat{y}$ which is the predicted values, that is predictable from the independent variable, the features – Taylor Swift's lyrics. Thus our 0.1712 indicates that roughly 17.12% of the variance in the year the song is released is explained by the song lyrics. Another way to say this is that the model captures 17.12% of the variability in your data. Keep in mind this is a low $R^2$ value, suggesting that the model may not be explaining a significant portion of the variance."

This is definitely reflected in our mean proper, non-overfitted, cross-validated $R^2$ (topics) that came out to be -47.472. The value of -47.472 suggests that, on average, my model is performing poorly when evaluated on different subsets of the data. This showcases that our model is not good for the data, which indicates that this model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data and is probably overfitting."

    "The confidence region is relatively wider, especially compared to the confidence interval above. There is more confidence in year 2013, which suggests that the model is more confident around this time period. Like when we ran on the entire dataset the model showcases a large bit of scatter around the line of best fit potentailly suggesting another model that could capture more factors to predict the year. We also want to recommend the same thing as above, which is in the future when there is more data available we could potentially look at Taylor Swift's mood, fashion, tour, etc. to predict the year better.\n",

    "Lemmatization reduces words to their base form helping the model identify similarities and relationships between the words. Though our dataset is 133 rows (133 songs) lemmatization can potentially help simplify the vocabulary and remove unnecessary variations–though personally I think our analysis in BERT later highlights how Taylor Swift's songs are very similar and thus lemmatization may have little benefit in this aspect as it would normally have. By reducing data sparsity Lemmatization can help the model learn effective representation of the text. Lemmatization brings all words to a common form ensuring all words are represented consistently, potentially aiding our model."

I also tried utilizing en_core_web_lg and it does not produce largely different results."

Thus our 0.2763 indicates that roughly 27.63% of the variance in the year the song is released is explained by the song lyrics. Another way to say this is that the model captures 27.63% of the variability in your data. Keep in mind this is a low $R^2$ value, suggesting that the model may not be explaining a significant portion of the variance. This is significantly better than our linear regression!"

This is definitely reflected in our mean proper, non-overfitted, cross-validated $R^2$ (topics) that came out to be -53.587. The value of -53.587 suggests that, on average, my model is performing poorly when evaluated on different subsets of the data. This showcases that our model is not good for the data, which indicates that this model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data and is probably overfitting."

    "To discover more about the text–Taylor Swift song lyrics–we utilize spaCy a free open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python. spaCy is used to build information extraction systems, which below I utilize its Part-of-speech (PS) Tagging which assigns word types to tokens. I specifically utilize adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, conjuctions, adverbs, nouns, numbers, etc. I also use Named Entities which is a \"real-world object\" that is assigned a name and spaCy can recognize these various types of named entities in a document. The named entities that I use are Person, Money, and Time. I specially chose these for Taylor Swift's lyrics as looking through all her albums she has mentions of all these tags. For example in `The Lucky One`, `Blank Space`, and `Anti-Hero` she explains how money has changed or caused people to take an action, in 139 songs Taylor Swift mentions `he`, for example, in `Begin Again` she sings 'He didn't like it when I wore high heels' and in `Better Man` she has many mentions of `he` and `they` not believing in her. Her song `22` is an ode to her turning 22 and has many mentions of `time` and many of her songs mention how time is fleeting or when someone calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also calculate and showcase the naïve and a cross-validated $R^2$ value for the linear regression prediction of date of the song release from these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: In an effort to compare whether specific tagging techniques could assist in the creation of a model and if it could produce better results then pushing all the song lyrics of the song in."

I thought it would do extremely well here as it is good at performing on small datasets and will not suffer from the curse of dimensionality bbecause of the limited dimensions in this dataset. It is also really good at handling outliers and noise in the data and effective for binary classification tasks like this one.\n",

In the end the best parameter combbination created a scorre of 0.5538 which is the cross-validation core after 10 cross validations."

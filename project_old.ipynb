    "# Final project guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Use these guidelines if and only if you are pursuing a **final project of your own design**. For those taking the final exam instead of the project, see the (separate) final exam notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines are intended for **undergraduates enrolled in INFO 3350**. If you are a graduate student enrolled in INFO 6350, you're welcome to consult the information below, but you have wider latitude to design and develop your project in line with your research goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to: identify an interesting problem connected to the humanities or humanistic social sciences that's addressable with the help of computational methods, formulate a hypothesis about it, devise an experiment or experiments to test your hypothesis, present the results of your investigations, and discuss your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks essentially replicate the process of writing an academic paper. You can think of your project as a paper in miniature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to present each of these tasks as you see fit. You should use narrative text (that is, your own writing in a markdown cell), citations of others' work, numerical results, tables of data, and static and/or interactive visualizations as appropriate. Total length is flexible and depends on the number of people involved in the work, as well as the specific balance you strike between the ambition of your question and the sophistication of your methods. But be aware that numbers never, ever speak for themselves. Quantitative results presented without substantial discussion will not earn high marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should reflect, at minimum, ten **or more** hours of work by each participant, though you will be graded on the quality of your work, not the amount of time it took you to produce it. Most high-quality projects represent twenty or more hours of work by each member.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pick an important and interesting problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "No amount of technical sophistication will overcome a fundamentally uninteresting problem at the core of your work. You have seen many pieces of successful computational humanities research over the course of the semester. You might use these as a guide to the kinds of problems that interest scholars in a range of humanities disciplines. You may also want to spend some time in the library, reading recent books and articles in the professional literature. **Problem selection and motivation are integral parts of the project.** Do not neglect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your project as a Jupyter notebook, along with all data necessary to reproduce your analysis. If your dataset is too large to share easily, let us know in advance so that we can find a workaround. If you have a reason to prefer a presentation format other than a notebook, likewise let us know so that we can discuss the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should have four basic sections (provided in cells below for ease of reference):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction and hypothesis.** What problem are you working on? Why is it interesting and important? What have other people said about it? What do you expect to find?\n",
    "2. **Corpus, data, and methods.** What data have you used? Where did it come from? How did you collect it? What are its limitations or omissions? What major methods will you use to analyze it? Why are those methods the appropriate ones?\n",
    "3. **Results.** What did you find? How did you find it? How should we read your figures? Be sure to include confidence intervals or other measures of statistical significance or uncetainty where appropriate.\n",
    "4. **Discussion and conclusions.** What does it all mean? Do your results support your hypothesis? Why or why not? What are the limitations of your study and how might those limitations be addressed in future work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of those sections, you may use as many code and markdown cells as you like. You may, of course, address additional questions or issues not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code used in the project should be present in the notebook (except for widely-available libraries that you import), but **be sure that we can read and understand your report in full without rerunning the code**. Be sure, too, to explain what you're doing along the way, both by describing your data and methods and by writing clean, well commented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes the place of the take-home final exam for the course. It is worth 35% of your overall grade. You will be graded on the quality and ambition of each aspect of the project. No single component is more important than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project is due at **noon on Saturday, December 9** via upload to CMS of a single zip file containing your fully executed Jupyter notebook and all associated data.\n",
    "* You may work alone or in a group of up to three total members.\n",
    "    * If you work in a group, be sure to list the names of the group members.\n",
    "    * For groups, create your group on CMS and submit one notebook for the entire group. **Each group should also submit a statement of responsibility** that describes in general terms who performed which parts of the project.\n",
    "* You may post questions on Ed, but should do so privately (visible to course staff only).\n",
    "* Interactive visualizations do not always work when embedded in shared notebooks. If you plan to use interactives, you may need to host them elsewhere and link to them.\n",

    "When we think of the words “heartbreak”, “love”, “growth”, “shake”, and “men”, our automatic first thought is Taylor Swift, the queen of pop. Seeing from the giant success of her eras tour, Taylor Swift creates music that resonates with a universal audience, and has been doing this since her debut album in 2006. Not only is Taylor Swift well-known for her songwriting skills, but she is also known for her ability to socially and culturally influence her fanbase through her music. There is a reason why people listen to Taylor Swift’s songs when they break up or listen to the song “22” when they turn 22. Now in 2023, her music has evolved with her, with each album representing a different “era” of her life. Each era has a different sound and feel, and we wanted to analyze how her sound has changed by examining the themes in her music. Her music addresses many topics that young women can relate to, spanning from heartbreak, love, etc., so we wanted to analyze these main themes to see where her influence mainly lies. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many conflicting opinions on Taylor Swift’s music over the years, with some saying that her music is repetitive in its nature, while others saying that it covers many different feels and topics. We will investigate this conflict in our analysis below."

    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "We read in Taylor Swift song lyrics and spotify data from a csv that adashofdata created and housed on a github repository: https://github.com/adashofdata/taylor_swift_data. We checked all her files and checked the lyrics and song names and confirmed that this data was 1) better than any Kaggle Dataset that we found 2) produced the same results as we would if we were to scrape Spotify for every Taylor Swift song. \n",
    "\n",
    "While adashofdata has way more spreadsheets then we needed, such as we ruled out needing Taylor_Swift_Set_List_Data which hosts a set list from her six tours, and Taylor_Swift_Words, which houses a breakdown of her lyrics into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also reviewed what adashofdata had done with the data, which she used to create a blog post: http://adashofdata.com/2023/03/01/a-data-scientist-breaks-down-all-10-taylor-swift-albums-the-extended-version/, a video virtually a summary of her blog post: https://youtu.be/ZNFms8sUbTw, and a few Reddit threads with the same findings: https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11g46c5/all_the_colors_mentioned_in_each_taylor_swift/, https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11f6xa8/taylor_swift_writes_a_song_in_every_key_on/, and https://www.reddit.com/r/TaylorSwift/comments/11mv3sn/taylor_says_she_imagines_writing_her_songs_with_3/. AdashofData's findings did not align with our discussion as below we look at how her song lyrics can assist in the prediction of which Year the song is released and whether we can classify a song as High Energy or not. Adashofdata's findings are indeed interesting and we support you if you wish to understand more about seasonality of Taylor Swift, which Days of the Week she talked about, swear words and more!"

    "**Limitations** of the data include the fact that we decided not to include any songs that Taylor Swift re-recorded: Fearless(Taylor's Version), Red(Taylor's Version), Speak Now (Taylor's Version), etc. This was due to the overlap and the fact that we desired to see if her music has potentially evolved or changed since starting her career and thus re-released songs would have potentially hindered our analysis.\n",

    "Other pitfalls include our data reviews 133 songs below, but songs that she created for another Artist/TV Shows/etc and lawsuits that occurred that made artists place her name on the writers list were not included. Also overlapping songs where she re-recorded with a featured artist were not included as well to avoid repetition. \n",

We believe that these are valid methods to analyze our data because they can help reveal how Taylor Swift's music has changed over time. Sentiment and frequency analysis will allow us to see how the sentiment in Taylor Swift's songs has changed. Song/lyric length analysis across eras and energy level anylsis of songs will help us track how much Taylor Swift's music sound and length has changed. BERT classification will allows us to track how lyrics have changed over different eras/albums. Topic modeling will allow us to see how the themes/topics within Taylor Swift's songs have changed over eras."

In addition, we predict that overall there will be a postive sentiment across her albums, with some albums have a greater sentiment as they may be tied to themes with less joyful emotion.

    "Method: The code above defines a Python function, `word_stats`, designed to analyze and summarize word frequencies in a given our dataset. The function takes a dictionary representing word frequencies, performs case folding (converting all words to lowercase), and removes English stopwords. It then prints information, including the list of stopwords, the total word count after processing, and the top 20 words with their frequencies. The most frequent words in the dataset is obtainde by considering case insensitivity and the exclusion of common English stopwords as well as custom set of stopwords tailored towards this dataset. Overall, MLTK's word_tokenize function, counter, case folding, and stopwords were some of the concepts utilized. \n",

    "Analysis: Based on the results from the graphs, we can see that for the following albums: 1989, Fearless, Lover, Midnights, Red, Speak Now, Taylor Swift, the top words were shake (78), know (61), want(49), karma (28), know (75), know (35), think(25), respectively. As we can see across three albums, Fearless, Red, and Speak Now, \"know\" was the most common word in all of the song lyrics combined. Similarly, the word that had the highest frequency count was \"shake\" and it had the highest count in the 1989 album. This repetition of the word \"know\" could suggest a notable thematic or lyrical emphasis on knowledge, understanding, or awareness in the song lyrics of these albums. However, while these specfic words may  provide more insight into the hypothesis, it is important to consider some drawbacks. For example, \"know\" might just be a common filler word that does'nt contribute to the meaning of her songs. In this case, sentiment analysis may be useful to combine with this. Adding on, one song in the 1989 album is \"Shake it Off\" which consists of the word \"shake\" repeated several times. This one song could have resulted in the top word for the album resulting in \"shake\" or skewing our result. Although, it may be accurate, it may not be important in the context it is being studied, so a improvment could creating a threshold for the frequency of a word occuring in each song, so it is not too excessive or too minimial.

    "Methods: For the sentiment analysis, a function was written that takes a VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object and returns a modified sentiment_dict. \n",
    ". The function adds a new dictionary key, Overall sentiment, to the sentiment_dict, the value of which is one of [positive, negative, neutral]` based on the compound key of sentiment_dict. A compound value greater than (or equal to) 0.05 is positive, less than (or equal to) -0.05 is negative, between is neutral.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: The sentiment analysis results showcase an overall positive tone across all albums and lyrics, with compound scores indicating predominantly positive sentiments. Among the individual albums, \"Red\" and \"Lover\" stand out with the highest positivity score, with the pos scores being 0.195 for both. This suggests that the lyrics of \"Red\" and \"Lover\" may convey a more positive and uplifting sentiment. On the other hand, when considering negativity scores, the data reveals that \"1989\" exhibits the highest negativity score among the albums, although still relatively low at 0.154. While this negativity score is minimal, it highlights a nuanced emotional range within the album's lyrics, suggesting that \"1989\" may incorporate diverse emotional themes, including moments of reflection or introspection. Overall, these sentiment analysis results not only emphasize the prevailing positivity in the lyrics but also provide insights into specific albums that showcase the greatest positivity and, to a lesser extent, moments of negativity."

One noticable distress is the fact that there is quite a bit of scatter around the line of best fit suggesting that there is some noise in the data or the model is not able to perfectly capture all the factors that influence an album release date, in the future when there is more data available we could potentially look at Taylor Swift's mood, fashion, tour, etc. to predict the year better.\n",

Thus our 0.1712 indicates that roughly 17.12% of the variance in the year the song is released is explained by the song lyrics. Another way to say this is that the model captures 17.12% of the variability in your data. Keep in mind this is a low $R^2$ value, suggesting that the model may not be explaining a significant portion of the variance."

This is definitely reflected in our mean proper, non-overfitted, cross-validated $R^2$ (topics) that came out to be -47.472. The value of -47.472 suggests that, on average, my model is performing poorly when evaluated on different subsets of the data. This showcases that our model is not good for the data, which indicates that this model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data and is probably overfitting."

    "The confidence region is relatively wider, especially compared to the confidence interval above. There is more confidence in year 2013, which suggests that the model is more confident around this time period. Like when we ran on the entire dataset the model showcases a large bit of scatter around the line of best fit potentailly suggesting another model that could capture more factors to predict the year. We also want to recommend the same thing as above, which is in the future when there is more data available we could potentially look at Taylor Swift's mood, fashion, tour, etc. to predict the year better.\n",

    "Lemmatization reduces words to their base form helping the model identify similarities and relationships between the words. Though our dataset is 133 rows (133 songs) lemmatization can potentially help simplify the vocabulary and remove unnecessary variations–though personally I think our analysis in BERT later highlights how Taylor Swift's songs are very similar and thus lemmatization may have little benefit in this aspect as it would normally have. By reducing data sparsity Lemmatization can help the model learn effective representation of the text. Lemmatization brings all words to a common form ensuring all words are represented consistently, potentially aiding our model."

Thus our 0.2763 indicates that roughly 27.63% of the variance in the year the song is released is explained by the song lyrics. Another way to say this is that the model captures 27.63% of the variability in your data. Keep in mind this is a low $R^2$ value, suggesting that the model may not be explaining a significant portion of the variance. This is significantly better than our linear regression!"

The value of -53.587 suggests that, on average, my model is performing poorly when evaluated on different subsets of the data.

    "To discover more about the text–Taylor Swift song lyrics–we utilize spaCy a free open-source library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python. spaCy is used to build information extraction systems, which below I utilize its Part-of-speech (PS) Tagging which assigns word types to tokens. I specifically utilize adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, conjuctions, adverbs, nouns, numbers, etc. I also use Named Entities which is a \"real-world object\" that is assigned a name and spaCy can recognize these various types of named entities in a document. The named entities that I use are Person, Money, and Time. I specially chose these for Taylor Swift's lyrics as looking through all her albums she has mentions of all these tags. For example in `The Lucky One`, `Blank Space`, and `Anti-Hero` she explains how money has changed or caused people to take an action, in 139 songs Taylor Swift mentions `he`, for example, in `Begin Again` she sings 'He didn't like it when I wore high heels' and in `Better Man` she has many mentions of `he` and `they` not believing in her. Her song `22` is an ode to her turning 22 and has many mentions of `time` and many of her songs mention how time is fleeting or when someone calls. \n",

It is also really good at handling outliers and noise in the data and effective for binary classification tasks like this one.\n",

To do this, we removed punctuation from each string, and removed case sensitivity, using counter to then count the most common words. Without stop words, the most common words were all practically the same, with words such as \"I\" and \"know\" dominating. With stop words, the words differentiate, but it is clear that most of the words are still similar, with words like \"never\", \"wanna\", \"want\", etc. being in the top 15 most common words for multiple albums. Also, it is clear that some common words that are more unique, sych as \"karma\" in *Midnights* and \"last\" and \"time' in *Red* are simply from one song on the album having a word repeated many times in a singular song rather than throughout the album."

    "Here, we chose to use the standard 80-20 train/test split, and did not create a validation set due to the limit of the number of songs here (only 147), so splitting by 80 and 20 was a good way to split up the songs without making train/test too small/big. To do this split, we used the train_test_split function, setting the random state to 42 for reproducibility, and adding the stratify parameter to make the distribution of the labels in the train and text sets based on how many songs were in each album in the original dataset. This is important to keep the authenticity of the data and not skew the results when creating these randomized sets of the training and testing data. The other option to doing this to this was randomly sampling 11 songs per album, as there are 11 songs on the shortest album. However, because our dataset was already so small, we thought it would be better to keep all the songs to maximize how well the model could learn."

I used this as the baseline method as logistic regression typically works well with classification, so it would work well as a baseline to compare from due to its efficiency and simplicity. I cross_validated this to provide a more reliable estimate for the model's performance. However, it performed pretty bad, with a cross-validated score 0f 0.09. It seemed to have a hard time placing each song into an album category and seemed to favor only a couple of classes, giving 0 for the rest. I tried going back to randomly sampling 11 of each album to try to make it more even in its distribution, but it seemed to have worse results due to further limiting the dataset size."

    "I then chose to train and evaluate the TF-IDF baseline model with the Random Forest classifier. I used TruncatedSVD to reduce the dimensionality of my dataset so I could use the Random Forest classifier. However, I still got a pretty bad cross-validated score of 0.1. I also tried other classifiers such as Gaussian NB, but it had similar results to this. It seems as if this is an issue of prediction that using different classifiers couldn't fix, which makes it an inherent issue with how feasible it is for classifiers to determine the relationships between lyrics and album. This is probably because of our dataset size, of having essentially 11-15 songs per category for the models to learn from, which is very limiting. Also, because songs even on a single album differ from each other, it would be very hard to find lots of patterns between them."

These results were pretty bad as well, increasing very slightly from the baselines, but still being pretty much random. I did not cross-validate due to run-time constraints on my computer (Google Colab would require me to purchase additional space), but from the classification report it was pretty clear how poor the model performed, due to only folklore and reputation having oaky values and the rest having 0. This is a trend similar to how the baselined performed, but for different albums, showing how random this was."

    "Overall, from examining the performance of the baseline classifiers and the Bert Models, it is clear that the results were very poor, with the misclassifications far outweighing the correct classifications. This made it seem like there was an inherent issue with analyzing lyric-album correlations rather than Bert versus Baseline performances. From examining the results, it seemed that the main reasons for this were:\n",
    "1. Limitations in dataset size:\n",
    "  Originally when going with this idea of album prediction based on song lyrics, I had thought that with 147 songs, this was sufficient for the model to learn from, as I had thought back to P5 where we were doing this with 97 poems and it seemed to have decent results (at least above random). However, from seeing the poor results, it made me realize that those results were probably in effect to having only 2 categories to tag from, \"nature\" and \"other\". Similarly, in the lecture notes on Bert Classification, even though we had 8 categories, a similar number to this, we had 1000 texts per category, so it was able to have substantial information on each label. In comparison, here we had 10 albums to categorize into, making it so there were only around 10-20 songs per album to learn from. Thus, the models did not have much of a change to learn trends, and thus ended up misclassfying everything as 2 different albums (in Bert's case it kept classifying everything as Reputation or Lover as it probably learned most only from those). A further exploration would be seeing whether these models could classify between 2 albums accurately instead of all 10, similar to \"nature\" versus \"other\". However, for this dataset, this idea would not work, as then we would have a dataset of around 30 songs maximum, which is too small to effectively do any training/testing. Perhaps, using each sentence in a song rather than an entire song as one entry in contents could help with maximizing our dataset. This would be very hard for me to feasibly do due to tokenization constraints with song lyrics being so inconsistent with punctuation. However, it could be a very interesting future study!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model limitations in classifying lyrics per album:\n",
    "  Another inherent problem with classifying song lyrics particularly is that with text processing, we lose context of how the song sounds which is what makes songs most distinct. Taylor Swift is aclaimed to have a different feel for each of her \"eras\", which is why we had thought that predicting lyrics to album could potentially be successful. However, a large portion of this uniqueness comes to how it sounds, with factors such as \"the maturity of her voice showing what year it could be from\", \"the instrumentals\", etc. playing a large portion. This is why it is very easy to classify which album for a human, but would be hard for a model. This reminds me of the reading we did in class related to genre tagging for songs, which I think would have similar constraints. Additionally, further examining the texts showed that a lot of songs had the same words used, which would harm the models in being able to use clues there. Even removing stopwords didn't help with that, as that removed any context between words. Thus, due to the multi-faceted nature of music as well as commonalities between Taylor Swift songs across her albums made these models perform poorly.\n",
